# Computer_Vision

In this repository you can find some **codes/tutorials** for object detection,    
- [Face_Smile_Recognition](https://github.com/JesusGomezHernandez/Computer_Vision/tree/master/Face_Smile_Recognition) based on Haar Cascade Algorithms.    
- [SSD_Object_Detection](https://github.com/JesusGomezHernandez/Computer_Vision/tree/master/SSD_Object_Detection) based on SSD Neural Network.

Codes are in spanish commented only, due to plenty of english available literature.
The yaml enviroment file is also available.    
If there is an error like this 'ImportError: /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libatk-1.0.so.0: undefined symbol: g_log_structured_standard' running the codes, it can be solved running: 'conda install -c anaconda glib'
